# AndroidFaceRegcontion
This is a small project about face regconition on Android device, this project is heavily inspired by the Tensorflow Android   
demo app and it is based on the MTCNN4Android implementation of [vcvycy](https://github.com/vcvycy/MTCNN4Android/tree/master/app) and the famous [Facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) implementation with a homemade kNN to perform recognition.
## Notice
This project is an under construction project and should not be taken into production or (maybe) thesis by any mean :))
## TODO list:
1. Reimplement the MTCNN and the facenet in Tensorflow Lite (Lite version is not fully developed at the moment, so i stayed with the Tensorflow Interface)
2. Implement a SVM library with Java, i tried libSVM and i must say i am not a fan of libSVM, so maybe in the future, i will come back and reimplement the SVM.
3. Implement the training (adding) n
